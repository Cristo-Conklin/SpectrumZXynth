## SpectrumZXynth Project

### About the Program

SpectrumZXynth is an innovative audio processing tool that transforms various forms of data into unique auditory experiences. It leverages the nostalgic 8-bit audio aesthetic, reminiscent of the ZX Spectrum era, to create distinctive soundscapes and compositions.

This program reads input data files, interprets them as audio signals, and converts these signals into music tracks. It uses advanced algorithms to map data bytes to musical tones, creating a harmonious blend of retro and modern sound textures.
